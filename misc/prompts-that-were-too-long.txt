The body of your rocket is a paper tube.  A narrow tube will be lighter and reduce air resistance so your rocket will fly higher.  A wide tube will increase the visibility of your rocket allow for a small payload such as an egg.  Would you like to use a narrow or wide tube?

Your rocket will need fins near the base of the body to provide stability during flight.  Air passing over the fins keeps the rocket on a straight flight path.  Your rocket can have three to five fins.  How many would you like?

Your rocket will need a rounded or pointed nose cone so that air will flow around the rocket body during flight which will reduce drag.  Drag is the force of air resisting the rocket's flight.  Would you like your rocket to have a pointed nose cone or a rounded nose cone?

You follow the instructions in your kit to build your rocket.  First you glue a clip to hold the motor in the base of the body and a small tube on the outside of the body called a launch lug.  Next, you glue the fins to the base of the body.  You then tie one end of a thin rubber strap called a shock cord to a screw in the nose cone and glue the other end to the inside of the body near the top.  You attach the string of the parachute to the nose cone screw to complete the recovery system.  Your rocket is assembled and now it is time to paint it.  What color do you want to paint the nose cone?

What color do you want to paint the body?

What color do you want to paint the fins?

You can decorate your rocket with decals.  You can choose from vertical strips that run lengthwise on the rocket body, horizontal stripes that wrap around it, polka dots, stars, unicorns, or none.

You wait for a calm day with clear weather to launch your rocket.  You have inserted an engine and ignitor in your rocket and place it on the launch pad by feeding the launch rod through the lug on the side of your rocket.  You connect your launch controller with a long wire to the igniter and insert the launch key at a safe distance.  A light on the controller indicates you are ready for launch.  To launch your rocket count down from ten now.
